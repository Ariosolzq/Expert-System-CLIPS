# Expert Systems: Barley Grain Diagnosis and Animal Classification
Two expert systems developed in CLIPS: 
1. A diagnostic tool for barley grain diseases, using intelligent inference to identify symptoms and remedies.
2. An animal classification system, categorizing animals based on characteristics and behaviors. Showcases CLIPS' application in agriculture and biology

## Overview
This repository contains two expert systems developed using CLIPS: 
1. **Barley Grain Diagnosis System**: A diagnostic tool for identifying barley grain diseases.
2. **Animal Classification System**: A system for classifying animals based on various attributes.

## Features
- **Barley Grain Diagnosis**: Uses rule-based logic to diagnose diseases based on symptoms.
- **Animal Classification**: Classifies animals using a set of rules derived from their physical and behavioral characteristics.

## Development
Developed using CLIPS, a powerful tool for building expert systems, both projects utilize production rules for knowledge representation and inference.

## Usage
To use these systems, load the respective `.clp` files in the CLIPS environment and follow the prompts for input.

## Installation
- Install CLIPS from [CLIPS Official Website](http://www.clipsrules.net/).
- Clone this repository and load the `.clp` files into the CLIPS environment.

## Contributing
Contributions to enhance the existing systems or add new functionalities are welcome.
